# Loading Constraint Demo

This project stemmed from a [blog post](http://webtonio.com/xamarin-loading-autloayout). 

It augments the [Loading example](http://developer.xamarin.com/recipes/ios/standard_controls/popovers/display_a_loading_message/) by Xamarin. The example covers creating a Loading View with absolute positioned UI objects. This project removes the absolute positioning and replaces them with constraints using the NSLayoutConstraint class.

Any recommendations are welcomed, create an issue and/or submit a pull request please!
